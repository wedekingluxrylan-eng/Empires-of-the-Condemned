## Bugs and suggesions
If you've found a bug or would like to suggest a change or a new feature, you can use [issues](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether/issues).

## Writing code
If you'd like to contribute to the project directly by writing code, first [fork the repository](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether/fork).
Then clone your forked repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your name>/GodotTogether.git
```

### Creating a branch
Then I **highly** recommend you create a separate branch instead of committing to `main`, so you can submit multiple pull requests.

```
git checkout -b my-epic-patch
```
Pushing your branch
```
git push -u origin my-epic-patch
```
(`-u` sets the default push target and is optional. After it's been used once, you can just use `git push`)

#### Why? 
If there's an issue with one part of your code but other work properly, they can already be merged and the broken part can wait until it's fixed.

#### I forgot to create a branch but I want to make a separate pull request
Simply branch off an older commit. See:
```
git log
```
To find the hash (for example a1Cx10dk01d01d), then use
```
git checkout -b <name of your new branch> <commit hash>
```
To branch off that older commit.

### Committing code
Use `git` (or the GitHub website, although that's very slow) to commit your changes.

Make sure to commit each change instead of making a one big commit so you can debug and see individual changes in your code.

❌ **Bad example**
```
git commit -m "General"
```
(has a lot of changes)

✅ **Good example**
```
git commit -m "Fixed some_function() not returning"
```
```
git commit -m "Added and using another_function()"
```
```
git commit -m "Fixed lag when X is enabled"
```
```
git commit -m "Cleanup"
```


### Rules
#### No AI generated code
AI tools such as ChatGPT can be useful tools for analysis, explanations, showing examples and debugging, but you cannot use them
to write entire sections of code with it as you're not the person who writes the code then.

You must have full understanding of the code you write and thus using AI generated code in this project is not allowed.

#### Code style
The [default GDScript style](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) is used in the project.

The general rules include:
- `snake_case_naming` for variables and functions
- `UpperCamelCaseNaming` for classes
- Newline separations between sections of code 

However, you should use one line statements if using `return` to stop the function and if the condition is short.
```gdscript
func some_function():
	if something_is_bad: return
	if or_that: return

	do_stuff()
```

#### Type hints
All variables, function return values and function arguments must have types assigned to them.

For example:
```gdscript
class_name Person

var name := "Anonymous"
var age: int

func greet(other_person: Person) -> String:
	return "Hello, %s. My name is %s" % [other_person.name, name]
```

For more info see [the Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html).

#### Use class prefixes
All defined classes should start with the `GDT` prefix to make sure the plugin doesn't conflict with users' projects.

❌ **Bad**:
```gdscript
class_name User
```

✅ **Good**:
```gdscript
class_name GDTUser
```

#### No author comments
Please don't add comments saying which features were made by you.

If you make a significant contribution, you will be put in the special thanks section in the plugin's about menu.
Also most likely you and your PR will be mentioned on the release page (when a stable version is released).

```gdscript
# Some feature by XYZ
func some_function():
	...
```

#### Testing
Your changes must obviously be manually tested before opening a pull request.

You must also run **unit tests**, which validate values returned by various functions based on the expected result and also validate the plugin's configuration.

To run them, enable the plugin, go to the **settings** and use **run unit tests now** or enable **run unit tests on start**.
After that, check the console.
