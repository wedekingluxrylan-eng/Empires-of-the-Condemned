## Installation
First create a folder called `addons` in your project's directory.

### Getting the plugin
>[!NOTE]
> As the plugin is not fully released, you're going to download the **current state of development** which may be unstable. 

#### With Git (recommended)
Open the terminal in your `addons` folder, then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether.git
```

Then proceed to the [enabling section](#enabling).

#### Manual download

1. [Download the source code](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) zip.
2. Extract the zip contents into your `addons` folder.
3. Rename `GodotTogether-main` to `GodotTogether`. IMPORTANT!!!

The structure should look like this

      |_ scenes
```

You will see results in the output console.

### Writing tests
To create a test:
1. Go to `src/scripts/tests.gd`.
2. Create a function called `test_your_test_name` and typehint its return value as `bool`
3. Return `true` or `false` based on if the test failed or succeed, and use `printerr` to explain details of the error
4. Call it in `run_tests` using `exec_test` as seen there.
